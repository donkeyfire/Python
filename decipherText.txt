lamb to the slaughter  by roald dahl   the room was warm and clean the curtains drawn the two table lamps alight  hers and the one by the empty chair opposite on the sideboard behind her two tall glasses soda water whiskey  fresh ice cubes in the thermos bucket  mary maloney was waiting for her husband to come him from work  now and again she would glance up at the clock but without anxiety merely to please herself with the thought that each minute gone by made it nearer the time when he would come  there was a slow smiling air about her and about everything she did  the drop of a head as she bent over her sewing was curiously tranquil  her skin  for this was her sixth month with child  had acquired a wonderful translucent quality the mouth was soft and the eyes with their new placid look seemed larger darker than before when the clock said ten minutes to five she began to listen and a few moments later punctually as always she heard the tires on the gravel outside and the car door slamming the footsteps passing the window the key turning in the lock  she laid aside her sewing stood up and went forward to kiss him as he came in  hullo darling she said  hullo darling he answered  she took his coat and hung it in the closer  then she walked over and made the drinks a strongish one for him a weak one for herself and soon she was back again in her chair with the sewing and he in the other opposite holding the tall glass with both hands rocking it so the ice cubes tinkled against the side  for her this was always a blissful time of day  she knew he didnt want to speak much until the first drink was finished and she on her side was content to sit quietly enjoying his company after the long hours alone in the house  she loved to luxuriate in the presence of this man and to feel  almost as a sunbather feels the sun  that warm male glow that came out of him to her when they were alone together  she loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair for the way he came in a door or moved slowly across the room with long strides  she loved intent far look in his eyes when they rested in her the funny shape of the mouth and especially the way he remained silent about his tiredness sitting still with himself until the whiskey had taken some of it away  tired darling  yes he said  im tired  and as he spoke he did an unusual thing  he lifted his glass and drained it in one swallow although there was still half of it at least half of it left she wasnt really watching him but she knew what he had done because she heard the ice cubes falling back against the bottom of the empty glass when he lowered his arm  he paused a moment leaning forward in the chair then he got up and went slowly over to fetch himself another  ill get it she cried jumping up  sit down he said  when he came back she noticed that the new drink was dark amber with the quantity of whiskey in it  darling shall i get your slippers  no  she watched him as he began to sip the dark yellow drink and she could see little oily swirls in the liquid because it was so strong  i think its a shame she said that when a policeman gets to be as senior as you they keep him walking about on his feet all day long  he didnt answer so she bent her head again and went on with her sewing bet each time he lifted the drink to his lips she heard the ice cubes clinking against the side of the glass  darling she said  would you like me to get you some cheese  i havent made any supper because its thursday  no he said  if youre too tired to eat out she went on its still not too late  theres plenty of meat and stuff in the freezer and you can have it right here and not even move out of the chair  her eyes waited on him for an answer a smile a little nod but he made no sign  anyway she went on ill get you some cheese and crackers first  i dont want it he said  she moved uneasily in her chair the large eyes still watching his face  but you must eat  ill fix it anyway and then you can have it or not as you like  she stood up and placed her sewing on the table by the lamp  sit down he said  just for a minute sit down  it wasnt till then that she began to get frightened  go on he said  sit down  she lowered herself back slowly into the chair watching him all the time with those large bewildered eyes  he had finished the second drink and was staring down into the glass frowning  listen he said  ive got something to tell you  what is it darling  whats the matter  he had now become absolutely motionless and he kept his head down so that the light from the lamp beside him fell across the upper part of his face leaving the chin and mouth in shadow  she noticed there was a little muscle moving near the corner of his left eye  this is going to be a bit of a shock to you im afraid he said  but ive thought about it a good deal and ive decided the only thing to do is tell you right away  i hope you wont blame me too much  and he told her  it didnt take long four or five minutes at most and she say very still through it all watching him with a kind of dazed horror as he went further and further away from her with each word  so there it is he added  and i know its kind of a bad time to be telling you bet there simply wasnt any other way  of course ill give you money and see youre looked after  but there neednt really be any fuss  i hope not anyway  it wouldnt be very good for my job  her first instinct was not to believe any of it to reject it all  it occurred to her that perhaps he hadnt even spoken that she herself had imagined the whole thing  maybe if she went about her business and acted as though she hadnt been listening then later when she sort of woke up again she might find none of it had ever happened  ill get the supper she managed to whisper and this time he didnt stop her  when she walked across the room she couldnt feel her feet touching the floor  she couldnt feel anything at all   except a slight nausea and a desire to vomit  everything was automatic now  down the steps to the cellar the light switch the deep freeze the hand inside the cabinet taking hold of the first object it met  she lifted it out and looked at it  it was wrapped in paper so she took off the paper and looked at it again  a leg of lamb  all right then they would have lamb for supper  she carried it upstairs holding the thin bone  end of it with both her hands and as she went through the living  room she saw him standing over by the window with his back to her and she stopped  for gods sake he said hearing her but not turning round  dont make supper for me  im going out  at that point mary maloney simply walked up behind him and without any pause she swung the big frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brought it down as hard as she could on the back of his head  she might just as well have hit him with a steel club  she stepped back a pace waiting and the funny thing was that he remained standing there for at least four or five seconds gently swaying  then he crashed to the carpet  the violence of the crash the noise the small table overturning helped bring her out of he shock  she came out slowly feeling cold and surprised and she stood for a while blinking at the body still holding the ridiculous piece of meat tight with both hands  all right she told herself  so ive killed him  it was extraordinary now how clear her mind became all of a sudden  she began thinking very fast  as the wife of a detective she knew quite well what the penalty would be  that was fine  it made no difference to her  in fact it would be a relief  on the other hand what about the child  what were the laws about murderers with unborn children  did they kill then both  mother and child  or did they wait until the tenth month  what did they do  mary maloney didnt know  and she certainly wasnt prepared to take a chance  she carried the meat into the kitchen placed it in a pan turned the oven on high and shoved t inside  then she washed her hands and ran upstairs to the bedroom  she sat down before the mirror tidied her hair touched up her lops and face  she tried a smile  it came out rather peculiar  she tried again  hullo sam she said brightly aloud  the voice sounded peculiar too  i want some potatoes please sam  yes and i think a can of peas  that was better  both the smile and the voice were coming out better now  she rehearsed it several times more  then she ran downstairs took her coat went out the back door down the garden into the street  it wasnt six oclock yet and the lights were still on in the grocery shop  hullo sam she said brightly smiling at the man behind the counter  why good evening mrs maloney  howre you  i want some potatoes please sam  yes and i think a can of peas  the man turned and reached up behind him on the shelf for the peas  patricks decided hes tired and doesnt want to eat out tonight she told him  we usually go out thursdays you know and now hes caught me without any vegetables in the house  then how about meat mrs maloney  no ive got meat thanks  i got a nice leg of lamb from the freezer  oh  i dont know much like cooking it frozen sam but im taking a chance on it this time  you think itll be all right  personally the grocer said i dont believe it makes any difference  you want these idaho potatoes  oh yes thatll be fine  two of those  anything else the grocer cocked his head on one side looking at her pleasantly  how about afterwards  what you going to give him for afterwards  well  what would you suggest sam  the man glanced around his shop  how about a nice big slice of cheesecake  i know he likes that  perfect she said  he loves it  and when it was all wrapped and she had paid she put on her brightest smile and said thank you sam  goodnight  goodnight mrs maloney  and thank you  and now she told herself as she hurried back all she was doing now she was returning home to her husband and he was waiting for his supper and she must cook it good and make it as tasty as possible because the poor man was tired and if when she entered the house she happened to find anything unusual or tragic or terrible then naturally it would be a shock and shed become frantic with grief and horror  mind you she wasnt expecting to find anything  she was just going home with the vegetables mrs patrick maloney going home with the vegetables on thursday evening to cook supper for her husband  thats the way she told herself  do everything right and natural  keep things absolutely natural and therell be no need for any acting at all  therefore when she entered the kitchen by the back door she was humming a little tune to herself and smiling  patrick she called  how are you darling  she put the parcel down on the table and went through into the living room and when she saw him lying there on the floor with his legs doubled up and one arm twisted back underneath his body it really was rather a shock  all the old love and longing for him welled up inside her and she ran over to him knelt down beside him and began to cry her heart out  it was easy  no acting was necessary  a few minutes later she got up and went to the phone  she know the number of the police station and when the man at the other end answered she cried to him quick  come quick  patricks dead  whos speaking  mrs maloney  mrs patrick maloney  you mean patrick maloneys dead  i think so she sobbed  hes lying on the floor and i think hes dead  be right over the man said  the car came very quickly and when she opened the front door two policeman walked in  she know them both  she know nearly all the man at that precinct  and she fell right into a chair then went over to join the other one who was called omalley kneeling by the body  is he dead she cried  im afraid he is  what happened  briefly she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to find him on the floor  while she was talking crying and talking noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead mans head  he showed it to omalley who got up at once and hurried to the phone  soon other men began to come into the house  first a doctor then two detectives one of whom she know by name  later a police photographer arrived and took pictures and a man who know about fingerprints  there was a great deal of whispering and muttering beside the corpse and the detectives kept asking her a lot of questions  but they always treated her kindly  she told her story again this time right from the beginning when patrick had come in and she was sewing and he was tired so tired he hadnt wanted to go out for supper  she told how shed put the meat in the oven  its there now cooking   and how shed slopped out to the grocer for vegetables and come back to find him lying on the floor  which grocer one of the detectives asked  she told him and he turned and whispered something to the other detective who immediately went outside into the street  in fifteen minutes he was back with a page of notes and there was more whispering and through her sobbing she heard a few of the whispered phrases  acted quite normalvery cheerfulwanted to give him a good supper peascheesecakeimpossible that she  after a while the photographer and the doctor departed and two other men came in and took the corpse away on a stretcher  then the fingerprint man went away  the two detectives remained and so did the two policeman  they were exceptionally nice to her and jack noonan asked if she wouldnt rather go somewhere else to her sisters house perhaps or to his own wife who would take care of her and put her up for the night  no she said  she didnt feel she could move even a yard at the moment  would they mind awfully of she stayed just where she was until she felt better  she didnt feel too good at the moment she really didnt  then hadnt she better lie down on the bed  jack noonan asked  no she said  shed like to stay right where she was in this chair  a little later perhaps when she felt better she would move  so they left her there while they went about their business searching the house  occasionally on of the detectives asked her another question  sometimes jack noonan spoke at her gently as he passed by  her husband he told her had been killed by a blow on the back of the head administered with a heavy blunt instrument almost certainly a large piece of metal  they were looking for the weapon  the murderer may have taken it with him but on the other hand he may have thrown it away or hidden it somewhere on the premises  its the old story he said  get the weapon and youve got the man  later one of the detectives came up and sat beside her  did she know he asked of anything in the house that couldve been used as the weapon  would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing  a very big spanner for example or a heavy metal vase  they didnt have any heavy metal vases she said  or a big spanner  she didnt think they had a big spanner  but there might be some things like that in the garage  the search went on  she knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house  she could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside and sometimes she saw a flash of a torch through a chink in the curtains  it began to get late nearly nine she noticed by the clock on the mantle  the four men searching the rooms seemed to be growing weary a trifle exasperated  jack she said the next tome sergeant noonan went by  would you mind giving me a drink  sure ill give you a drink  you mean this whiskey  yes please  but just a small one  it might make me feel better  he handed her the glass  why dont you have one yourself she said  you must be awfully tired  please do  youve been very good to me  well he answered  its not strictly allowed but i might take just a drop to keep me going  one by one the others came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whiskey  they stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands uncomfortable in her presence trying to say consoling things to her  sergeant noonan wandered into the kitchen come out quickly and said look mrs maloney  you know that oven of yours is still on and the meat still inside  oh dear me she cried  so it is  i better turn it off for you hadnt i  will you do that jack  thank you so much  when the sergeant returned the second time she looked at him with her large dark tearful eyes  jack noonan she said  yes  would you do me a small favo
